\begin{abstract}
For a long time it was not only the weather but also the terrain that determined whether a paraglider could be flown. Towing winches could practically eliminate the terrain factor, but in order to cover all eventualities, both pull-in winches and roll-off winches still have to be purchased as a separate system. To counteract this, the DualModeWinch is being developed in this project. It covers both the pull-in winch and the roll-off winch in one system and is the first winch that combines both functions in one device. This is made possible by the installation of an electric motor, which can be operated both in forward and reverse direction. In addition, the power supply is provided by batteries, which (in comparison to conventional towing winches) enables low-noise, no C02 emission and an energy-efficient operation. The motor is monitored by a controller during the towing process and controlled accordingly to ensure that operation is as error-free and safe as possible.
The DualModeWinch is delivered as a complete package and can be transported in a car with boot size (hwl) 90x60x90cm. It is therefore suitable for private individuals as well as for larger paragliding clubs.
